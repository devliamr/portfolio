						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							Developed over seven weeks by a team of 12 members, including 3 programmers, Project Asylum is a narrative-driven horror puzzler built in <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> with a combination of <strong>Blueprints</strong> and <strong>C++</strong>. As a demolition inspector tasked with surveying an abandoned asylum, you quickly realize that the building isn’t what it seems—hallways shift, cryptic messages appear, and an unseen force stalks your every move. The environment itself is your enemy, dynamically changing to disorient, trap, and hunt you. Armed with only a UV light, uncover hidden clues, navigate the twisting maze, and escape before the asylum consumes you entirely.

						<h2>Contributions</h2>
						<p>
							During the seven-week development of Project Asylum, I took on multiple key responsibilities, both in programming and project coordination. For the entire development cycle, I was the version control manager, ensuring that Unreal Engine’s workflow remained stable and that merges, builds, and collaboration ran smoothly. In the second half of the project, I was appointed Lead Programmer, overseeing technical decisions, maintaining code structure, and ensuring smooth integration between systems. Beyond my leadership role, I focused on implementing core UI systems to enhance both gameplay functionality and accessibility.
						</p>

						<h3>Key Implementations</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Live Player Location on Map:</strong> Developed a 2D tracking system that accurately translates the player’s 3D position into a 2D representation on a clipboard map. This involved mapping world coordinates to UI space, scaling the map correctly, and ensuring real-time updates as the player moves. </li>
							<li><strong>Settings Menu:</strong> Designed and implemented a full settings system, allowing players to adjust volume, brightness, mouse sensitivity. Also added an accessibility mode, which marks key objectives on the map, providing guided navigation for players who want or need additional assistance.</li>
							<li><strong>Version Control Management:</strong> As the designated version control lead, I handled merging, resolving conflicts, and maintaining repository stability, ensuring that the team could work efficiently without disruptions from Unreal Engine’s quirks.</li>
							<li><strong>Lead Programmer (Second Half of Development):</strong> Stepped into a leadership role to coordinate the programming team, manage technical decisions, and oversee the integration of various systems, ensuring a smooth final product.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							These contributions allowed me to play a key role in both gameplay development and team coordination, helping to support my teammates and ensure that our systems worked together smoothly. Through collaboration and problem-solving, I aimed to make Project Asylum a more polished and accessible experience while learning from the challenges of working in a larger team.

						<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<h3>Balancing Team Roles with Programming
						</h3>
						<p>
							Taking on both version control management and lead programmer responsibilities in the second half of the project was a rewarding but challenging experience. Handling merges, build stability, and troubleshooting version control issues often pulled me away from my own programming tasks, making it difficult to maintain focus on complex implementations. Additionally, our team had fewer programmers than originally planned, meaning we had to take on more responsibilities to maintain the project’s quality. Balancing technical leadership with hands-on development required careful time management and constant communication, ensuring that both the team’s workflow and the game’s systems stayed on track. While it was a challenge, it gave me valuable experience in multitasking, problem-solving, and supporting my team beyond just writing code.
						</p>

					<!-- Reflection Section -->
					<section id="reflection">
						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>
							Working on Project Asylum was an eye-opening experience in both technical development and team coordination. Balancing my role as a lead programmer while managing version control pushed me to improve my time management, communication, and problem-solving skills. While it was sometimes challenging to juggle leadership responsibilities with programming tasks, it gave me a better understanding of what it takes to support a team beyond just writing code. Seeing everything come together—especially the dynamic map system and accessibility features—made the effort well worth it.
						</p>

						<h3>Biggest Takeaways</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Leadership is more than just coding: </strong> Managing version control and leading development meant making sure others could work efficiently, not just focusing on my own tasks.</li>
							<li><strong>Fewer programmers means higher expectations: </strong> With a smaller programming team than originally planned, each of us had to step up, take on more responsibilities, and ensure our work met a high standard to keep the project on track.</li>
						</ul>
