						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							Atomancer was a three-week project developed by a team of 12, including 4 programmers, using <strong>Unity (C#)</strong>, designed specifically for the <strong>Xbox Adaptive Controller</strong> to ensure accessibility for a wider audience.

							As a fast-paced horde survival roguelite, the game puts players in control of Hydro, the first atom after the Big Bang, fighting to survive against relentless void creatures. The goal is simple—adapt, evolve, and endure for 10 minutes to secure the future of the universe.
							
							Developing Atomancer was a challenging yet rewarding experience, pushing our team to balance engaging gameplay with intuitive, accessible controls.
						</p>
						<p>
							The project was recognized at the <strong>Futuregames Awards 2023</strong>, earning nominations for <strong>Best Design</strong>, <strong>Judges' Choice</strong>, and <strong>Best Tech</strong>, a testament to the team's dedication and innovation.

						<h2>Contributions</h2>
						<p>
							Over the course of the 10-day production cycle, I was responsible for implementing several core gameplay systems, focusing on player interactions, enemy logic, and game state management. These mechanics needed to be both scalable and responsive, ensuring smooth integration within the fast-paced roguelite design. Additionally, since the game was built for the Xbox Adaptive Controller, extra care was taken to provide clear player feedback and accessible controls.
						</p>

						<h3>Key Implementations</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Player Health System:</strong> Built a modular health system incorporating a damage cooldown mechanic, preventing consecutive hits from overwhelming the player. This ensured better game balance while maintaining the difficulty curve.</li>
							<li><strong>Enemy Health & Damage Scaling:</strong> Developed a centralized enemy health and damage system that dynamically adjusted based on four different enemy types. Since each enemy had varying attack patterns and damage outputs, the system needed to be scalable and allow for fine-tuned balancing without redundant code.</li>
							<li><strong>Game State Management:</strong> Implemented a robust win/lose state system that manages the transition between gameplay phases. This includes handling game-over conditions, triggering victory sequences, and ensuring seamless state transitions under various in-game scenarios.</li>
							<li><strong>Real-Time Directional Input Feedback:</strong> Designed a UI-based arrow indicator that translated the player’s movement input into a visual cue, helping bridge the gap between controller input and on-screen movement, particularly for adaptive control users.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							These systems weren’t just about functionality—they needed to be optimized, scalable, and responsive within a fast development cycle.

						<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<h3>Adapting to C# Under Tight Deadlines</h3>
						<p>
Coming into Atomancer, my programming background was primarily in Python and JavaScript, with only a limited exposure to C#. While the fundamental logic of programming carried over, the transition to a new language under a tight three-week deadline introduced a unique challenge.

C# required a different mindset, especially with its stronger emphasis on object-oriented programming, memory management, and Unity’s unique component-based architecture. Understanding how to efficiently structure game systems in C# within Unity—from handling game loops to optimizing update calls—was a learning curve that I had to navigate quickly and efficiently.

The challenge wasn’t just about understanding syntax but also about writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code that could integrate smoothly with my teammates’ work. With such a compressed timeline, I had to learn on the go, diving into documentation, dissecting existing Unity projects, and applying best practices immediately in a live development environment.

Despite the initial intensity, this experience accelerated my growth as a programmer, reinforcing my ability to adapt, problem-solve, and absorb new technical concepts quickly. By the end of the project, I had developed a solid grasp of C#, allowing me to contribute effectively to key gameplay systems and UI elements while maintaining a structured, readable codebase.
						</p>

						<h3>Learning to Navigate a Structured Team Environment</h2>
						<p>
							Before Atomancer, most of my programming experience was self-driven or in informal group projects, so stepping into a professional, structured team with strict roles, deadlines, and even signed contracts was an entirely new experience. Unlike personal projects, where I could work at my own pace, this environment required coordination, accountability, and clear communication—not just coding skills.

One of the biggest adjustments was adapting to well-defined roles. In a solo or casual team project, I was used to jumping between tasks, but here, I needed to trust my teammates' expertise while focusing on my own responsibilities. Learning when to take initiative versus when to ask for input was a key part of the process.

Another challenge was getting used to structured workflows—handling stand-up meetings, progress reports, and using industry-standard tools like version control and task management systems. These weren’t obstacles, but they required an adjustment period. Fortunately, I thrive in open and honest communication, so I quickly adapted by asking questions, absorbing feedback, and learning from my teammates.

By the end of the project, I had not only grown as a developer but also as a collaborator, understanding how to effectively integrate my work into a larger team, contribute to discussions, and maintain flexibility while still respecting structured workflows.

<section id="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        Working on Atomancer was a defining experience in my journey as a game developer. It was the first time I had to 
        adapt to a structured, professional team environment, work under tight deadlines, and learn a new programming language on the fly.
        Each of these challenges pushed me out of my comfort zone, but ultimately, they made me a stronger, more adaptable programmer.
    </p>

    <h3>Biggest Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Trust and Communication:</strong> Learning when to take initiative and when to ask for input was key to a smooth workflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Structured Development:</strong> Adapting to task management systems, version control, and team coordination strengthened my professional approach.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Skill Growth:</strong> Overcoming the challenge of learning C# in a high-pressure environment accelerated my programming capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
