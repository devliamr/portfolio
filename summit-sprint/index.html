						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							Summit Sprint was developed over five weeks by a team of 15 members, including 4 programmers, using <strong>Unity (C#)</strong>. This <strong>mobile speedrunning game</strong> challenges players to climb fast, plan routes, and master precision movement.

							Play solo, racing against personal bests, or challenge friends in <strong>turn-based multiplayer</strong>, where players take turns on a single device. After a run, the next player races against a recorded <strong>"ghost"</strong> of the previous attempt, creating a competitive, time-trial experience.
							
							With independent hand controls and stamina management, Summit Sprint delivers a fast-paced, skill-driven climbing challenge that rewards strategy and mastery.

						<h2>Contributions</h2>
						<p>
							During the five-week development period, I was responsible for implementing key gameplay systems, focusing on UI functionality, state management, and player experience design. These mechanics needed to be responsive, intuitive, and seamlessly integrated into the gameplay flow.

						<h3>Key Implementations</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Onboarding Level:</strong> Helped design and programmed a smooth, guided introduction to the game. This required implementing state-based tutorial triggers, adaptive UI transitions, and responsive input handling.</li>
							<li><strong>Game State Management (Pause, Win, Lose, and Menus):</strong> Developed core game states, including a fully functional pause menu, win/lose screens, and the main menu. Ensured smooth scene transitions, animation-driven UI, and state persistence for a polished user experience.</li>
							<li><strong>Level Selector & Scene Transitions:</strong> Implemented a level selection system with seamless scene transitions, ensuring a smooth and efficient navigation flow between levels.</li>
							<li><strong>UI Animations & Interaction:</strong> Developed animated UI elements for menus and gameplay feedback, focusing on responsive touch input, fluid transitions, and accessibility.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							These are just some of the contributions I made, all requiring optimized UI behavior, scalable state handling, and smooth user interaction to enhance the overall player experience.

						<h2>Challenges</h2>

						<h3>Mobile Development & UI Challenges
						</h3>
						<p>
							Developing Summit Sprint for mobile was an unexpected challenge since none of us had prior experience building mobile games. While we were comfortable with Unity’s core development workflow, optimizing for mobile devices required an entirely different approach, from UI scaling and input handling to performance constraints and hardware variability.

One of the biggest hurdles was playtesting, as we had a severe shortage of Android devices to test on, making it difficult to identify performance issues, touch input responsiveness, and scaling problems. Debugging mobile-specific issues was frustrating, as many problems wouldn't appear in Unity’s editor but surfaced only on actual devices. We had to rely on workarounds like remote debugging, emulators, and sporadic real-device testing, but these came with their own limitations.

This experience taught me a lot about UI and UX design for mobile, particularly how screen sizes, padding, and touch responsiveness impact usability. I gained a deeper understanding of how to optimize UI layouts, ensure proper touch target sizing, and balance clarity with functionality, all of which are crucial for creating a smooth and intuitive mobile experience.

						<h3>Designing an Onboarding Experience Under Pressure</h3>
						<p>
							Late into development, player feedback and playtesting revealed the need for a proper onboarding level, ensuring new players could quickly grasp the game’s mechanics. However, this presented a major challenge—an onboarding level requires an almost-finished game, meaning I was working under extremely tight time constraints in the final stretch of development.

With limited time, I had to balance clarity with efficiency, ensuring the tutorial felt intuitive, engaging, and non-intrusive, all while avoiding delays to the final release. This meant implementing smooth tutorial prompts, pausing mechanics, and dynamic textboxes that wouldn’t disrupt gameplay flow—all without slowing down development.

Surprisingly, the pressure of time came with an unexpected upside. Since the team was focused on polishing other aspects of the game, I was given more creative freedom to design the tutorial’s structure and pacing, allowing me to make quick, impactful decisions without excessive back-and-forth. This experience not only tested my ability to work efficiently under pressure, but also gave me a greater sense of ownership over the onboarding process, making it one of the most rewarding parts of the project.

						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>
							Working on Summit Sprint pushed me into mobile development, UI design, and tight-deadline problem-solving. With no prior mobile experience, I had to adapt quickly, figuring out touch input, performance issues, and UI scaling on the go. The fast pace forced me to make decisions efficiently, making this a challenging but rewarding project.

						<h3>Biggest Takeaways</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Mobile UI is its own challenge :</strong> Touch input, scaling, and performance change everything. I learned how small details like padding and responsiveness make a big impact.</li>
							<li><strong>Adaptability is key :</strong> Last-minute changes meant fast decisions and problem-solving. The onboarding level taught me to trust my judgment under pressure.</li>
							<li><strong>Deadlines sharpen focus:</strong> The time crunch forced me to prioritize, iterate fast, and avoid overcomplicating. It was stressful, but it made me more efficient.</li>
						</ul>
